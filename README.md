# Cookbook Delish

## What is Cookbook Delish?

Cookbook Delish is a recipe management web application written in PHP using CodeIgniter 4.

## What would I do differently?

The vanilla jQuery JavaScript is messy. I should have used a JavaScript framework like Vue.js but I wanted to keep the project simple.
CodeIgniter is more situated for building web applications in a traditional way, which is what I should have done, but I got carried away with implementing unnecessary JavaScript functionality into the project and forcing CodeIgniter to work with it. I ended up loosing interest in the project because of this and rushed to finish what I started.

## What did I learn?

I learned how to use CodeIgniter 4, coming from CodeIgniter 3. I found that CodeIgniter 4 upgraded a lot of things, such as the template system. For my older projects, I actually built my own template engine upon CodeIgniter 3's because I found it did not work like I wanted it to. I was happy to see that CodeIgniter 4's template system was much more powerful. I embrace CodeIgniter because of its simplicity and freedom - it does not force or restrain you to do things in a certain way.
